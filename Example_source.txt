{{This is a description of the CLS command.}}
{{The command can be used to, clear the whole screen, clear the line that the cursor is on, clear the screen above the cursor line or clear the screen below the cursor line.}}
{{It's very, very, useful as a command for, ahem, clearing the screen!}}

example:
{{This example shows how to clear the whole screen:}}
code: [[cls]]
notes:
1:{{
CLS cannot be used to clear non display channels.

Doing so would be a tad interesting, if you ask me!
}}

{{This, for example, would not work:}}

code: [[
1000 OPEN #3, "flp1_boot"
1010 CLS #3
1020 ...
