The files in the ``ANTRL4`` directory are as follows:

* ``include`` - A directory containing a large number of header files which are required when compiling ANTRL4 generated C++ sources. Do not mess with these files! Consider them READ ONLY! You have been warned.

* ``libantrl4-runtime.*``  - static and shared Linux 64 bit libraries required when linking ANTLR4 generated CPP applications. Again, do not mess with these files.

* ``antrl-4.7.1-complete.jar`` - a Java Jar file that is used when converting a *.g4 grammar file into some generated C++ files to build a parser from.
