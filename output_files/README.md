There are no files in this directory as you have yet to parse a source file with the ``USBMParser`` utility.

In order to do so, you should:

````
cd output_files
../USBMParser /location/of/source/file
````

After a short delay, this folder should be filled with new files, one for each keyword in the source file used as input.

Did I mention that you have to build the utility first though? Well, you have!
