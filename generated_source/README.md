The files in the ``generated_source`` directory are created when a ``*.g4`` grammar file is processed by the ANTLR4 parser generator (the ``antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`` file in the ``ANTLR4`` directory).

This action will generate a number of ``*.h``, ``*.cpp``, ``*.interp`` and ``*.tokens`` files. Don't mess with these files - any changes you make will be overwritten on the next processing of the grammar files.
